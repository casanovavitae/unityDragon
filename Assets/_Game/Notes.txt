Buildings can be touched: they push the player out of the level.

If the player goes out of the camera view, player loses 1 life and gets respawned.

Flying enemies can fly over buildings.

4-directional movement.

Physics-based reflection. Reflection hitbox speed increases with levels/over time.

Leaderboards (delight-feature is online leaderboards).

Powerups are in buildings.
Powerups are slowly absorbed towards the player (absorbtion distance needs to be tested).
Powerups can either be manually or automatically activated (test it!).

Sprite order: background -> road -> powerup -> building -> enemies -> player -> effects/projectiles.

Some projectiles might be irreflectible???

Checkpoints : when the player loses all lives, its position is set back to the latest checkpoint and the number of lives is reset.

The Player's VisibilityTrigger (tag "PlayerPositionThing") is only meant to be used by ground enemies,
so that they can check with a raycast whether they can see the player's "position" (they don't cast a ray directly toward
the player, but directly in front of them, if they hit the VisibilityTrigger that means they can "see the player" and should
therefore shoot). This only makes sense if the enemies only shoot forward and now directly at the player.
In any case, ground enemies should not shoot at buildings.
